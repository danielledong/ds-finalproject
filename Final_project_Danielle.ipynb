Scala and Flume Project Description The bank wanted to help its customers to avail different products of the bank through analyzing their expenditure behavior The customers spending ranges from online shopping medical expenses in hospitals cash transactions and debit card usage etc the behavior allows the bank to create an analytical report and based on which the bank used to display the product offers on the customer portal which was built using java The portal allows the customers to login and see their transactions which they make on a day to day basis the analytics also help the customers plan their budgets through the budget watch and my financial forecast applications embedded into the portal The portal used hadoop framework to analyes the data as per the rules and regulations placed by the regulators from the respective countries The offers and the interest rates also complied with the regulations and all these processing was done using the hadoop framework as big data analytics

is to build a Development Data Repository for Pfizer Inc Because all the downstream application are like Etrack TSP database S SADMS GFS GDO having their own sql request on the OLTP system directly due to which the performance of OLTP system goes slows down For this we have created a Development Data Repository to replace the entire sql request directly on the OLTP system DDR process extracts all clinical pre clinical study product subject sites related information from the upstream applications like EPECS CDSS RCM PRC E CLINICAL EDH and after applying some business logic put it into DDR core tables From these snapshot and dimensional layer are created which are used for reporting application Role Responsibilities To understand analyze the requirement documents and resolve the queries

    "F1-score is a measure of the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible score. A higher F1-score indicates a better balance between precision and recall, and thus a better performing model.\n",

    "KNN has a slightly higher training accuracy than SVC, but SVC has a slightly higher validation accuracy than KNN. This suggests that KNN might be overfitting to the training data, while SVC is able to generalize better to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the difference in F1-score and accuracy between the two methods is relatively small, it is still notable that SVC performs slightly better than KNN on both metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, based on these metrics, it seems that SVC might be a better choice for this problem. However, it is important to note that the performance of a model can be affected by various factors such as the size and quality of the dataset, the specific hyperparameters chosen for each algorithm, and the specific problem being addressed. Therefore, it is recommended to perform additional analysis and experimentation to make a more informed decision."

    "\n",
    "The x-axis represents the gamma parameter values, with values ranging from 10^-6 to 10^-1. The y-axis represents the score, which is the accuracy of the SVM model. The plot also includes shaded areas around the curves, representing the standard deviation of the scores.\n",

    "The curve for the training score shows that as the gamma parameter increases, the accuracy of the model on the training data increases. The validation curve fits perfectly with the training curve, it could indicate that the model is neither overfitting nor underfitting. This means that the model has learned to generalize well on both the training and validation sets, indicating that the model is a good fit for the data."
